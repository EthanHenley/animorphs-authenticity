We used the same strategy of leave-one-out validation as before. \n",

    "Unlike our Word2Vec-based models, the count-based SVM doesn't seem to predict lower probabilities over time within the non-ghostwritten first 24 books—it drops immediately at 25, pulls up at 26, and gets all that follow right. It does not percieve or get distracted by the content shift that decieved the W2V models, instead adhering more closely to pure style. It does curiously misclassify two early authentic books that most other models correctly predicted; however, were one to set the probability threshold low enough to meet these, one would have 100% accuracy. That this would even be necessary is an artifact of our leave-one-out methodology, but it signifies that our model is sufficient."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "It is somewhat disappointing that our Word2Vec-based model was outperformed by a simpler count-based model, but not every tool fits every task, and this is evidence that might help resolve disputes over its relevance to stylometry at large. \n",
    "\n",
    "That established, our count-based model was effective and accurate, and were a 55th canonical Animorphs book released today in the style of the 54 that preceded and with its authenticity unknown, we believe that the model would be well-suited to assess its authorship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Animorphs corpus may be an especially challenging problem for stylometry and authorship detection—it is a series of books with related but progressing content with authorship split mostly sequentially which was edited for consistency by the listed author even when she did not write a book. That an authorship detection model such as this can be established with high accuracy is a testament to the power of natural language processing, even without the involvement of neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many experiments in stylometry use standard, historic corpuses such as 'great' novels, the Federalist Papers, or the works of Shakespeare, but these corpuses are not representative of the diversity of English writing. We recommend that less formal writing—internet posts, film and television scripts, and yes, even children's and middle-grade book series—also be used as standards against which to assess stylometric techniques, and hope that this project shows that sylometry on informal writing can offer unique insights."
